# Near.B Backend services
 
## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [fuge](http://fuge.io/)


## First time setup

Each storage is inside its docker image, so the first time you'll have to run

`docker-compose -f compose-dev.yml pull`

To create the data volumes, run

```
docker create --name stores_db__data_volume -v /data/db mongo:3.2.7 '/bin/true'
```

## Run the app
```
fuge shell ./compose-dev.yml
fuge> start
```


### Checking if everything worked

Go [here](http://localhost:10000/api/location/list). 

If everything was fine, the proxy at port 10000 is redirecting the 
request to the the Mobile API, which is interacting with the Location API,
which in turns interacts with the Stores API


### Troubleshooting

#### Issues with MongoDb containers

> [initandlisten] Detected unclean shutdown - /data/db/mongod.lock is not empty.

Might be a cleaner way, but as a quick fix: rebuild the images. For example, with stores_db

```
docker-compose -f compose-dev.yml rm -v stores_db
docker-compose -f compose-dev.yml pull stores_db
```


> [stores_db - 21479]: docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint drunk_kirch (eaea99501446f0f169353e39e82bb5e06799175786282217674a0a13efb76a05): Bind for 0.0.0.0:11000 failed: port is already allocated.

`fuge` was not properly terminated, and some containers were still running.

Run `docker ps` and look for the container bound to that port and then 
`docker stop <container_id>`. For instance: 

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
