# Near.B Backend services
 
## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [fuge](http://fuge.io/)


## Run the app
```
fuge shell ./compose-dev.yml
fuge> start
```


### Checking if everything worked

Go [here](http://localhost:20000/api/location/list). 

If everything was fine, the Mobile API is interacting with the Location API,
which in turns interacts with the Stores API
